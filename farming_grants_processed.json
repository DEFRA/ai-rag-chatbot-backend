You must read the [SFI scheme information](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-scheme-expanded-offer-for-2024) to understand the scheme rules and how to apply.\n\n## Duration\n\n3 years\n\n## How much you’ll be paid\n\n£382 per hectare (ha) per year\n\n## Action’s aim\n\nThis action’s aim is that there’s an established herbal ley with:\n\n* a mixture of grasses, legumes and herbs or wildflowers to provide varied root structures\n* areas of flowering plants from late spring and during summer months\n\nThe purpose of this is to:\n\n* produce a high volume of forage with minimal use of inorganic fertiliser\n* improve resilience to drought\n* help improve and maintain the soil’s structure, carbon, biology and fertility\n\n## Where you can do this action\n\nYou can do this action on agricultural land located below the moorland line that’s:\n\n* an eligible land type (as defined in [section 5.1 ‘Eligible land types for SFI’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-scheme-expanded-offer-for-2024/sfi-scheme-information-expanded-offer-for-2024) in the SFI scheme information)\n* registered with an eligible land cover on your digital maps\n* declared with a [land use code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-payments-land-use-codes-2024/land-use-codes-2024) which is compatible with the eligible land cover\n\n### Eligible land\n\n| Eligible land type | Eligible land cover | Compatible land use code |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Arable land used to grow crops | Arable land | Land use codes for [arable crops](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-payments-land-use-codes-2024/land-use-codes-2024#al2) or [leguminous and nitrogen-fixing crops](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-payments-land-use-codes-2024/land-use-codes-2024#al3) |\n| Temporary grassland | Arable land | TG01 |\n| Arable land lying fallow | Arable land | FA01 |\n| Improved permanent grassland | Permanent grassland | PG01 |\n\n### Eligibility of protected land\n\n| Protected land | Eligibility |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) | Ineligible – you must not enter any area that’s designated as an SSSI into this action |\n| Historic and archaeological features | Ineligible – you must not enter any area with an historic or archaeological feature into this action. This only affects the area where the feature is located in a land parcel. You can apply for this action on the remaining area in the land parcel if it’s eligible. |\n\n### Available area you can enter into this action\n\nTotal or part of the available area in a land parcel.\n\n### Rotational or static action\n\nThis action is rotational or static. This means you can either:\n\n* move its location for the second and third year of this action’s rotation\n* do it at the same location each year of this action’s duration\n\n## What to do\n\nYou must establish an herbal ley with a mixture of grass, legumes and herbs on land entered into this action.\n\nYou must use a seed mix which includes all of the following (as a minimum):\n\n* 1 grass species\n* 2 legume species\n* 2 herb or wildflower species\n\nIf you’re establishing an herbal ley on land identified by you as being at risk of soil erosion or runoff, you must use establishment techniques which minimise the risk of soil erosion or runoff. You can use the soil management plan produced for CSAM1 (or SAM1) to identify this land. See action CSAM1 for more information.\n\nOnce the herbal ley is established, you must maintain it. To do this you must manage it in a way, and for a period of time, that can reasonably be expected to achieve this action’s aim.\n\nYou must minimise use of inorganic fertilisers containing nitrogen. Usually, this will be no more than around 40 kilograms (kg) of nitrogen per ha per year.\n\nYou must not use the established herbal ley for storage or apply pesticides on it, except:\n\n* for herbicides to weed wipe or spot treat to control [injurious weeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identification-of-injurious-weeds), [invasive non-native species](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prevent-the-spread-of-harmful-invasive-and-non-native-plants#types-of-invasive-non-native-plants), or nettles\n* to destroy the existing ley to establish a new herbal ley\n\nYou can maintain an existing herbal ley to get paid for this action if it:\n\n* meets this action’s requirements – you may need to re-sow it to make sure it can reasonably be expected to achieve this action’s aim\n* is not already being paid for under another environmental land management scheme option, such as Countryside Stewardship (CS) option GS4 (legume and herb-rich swards)\n\n## When to do it\n\nYou must:\n\n* establish the herbal ley by early autumn, within 12 months of this action’s start date\n* maintain the herbal ley at the same location for a period of time that can reasonably be expected to achieve this action’s aim – this will usually be until the end of the second summer after sowing\n* re-establish the herbal ley by early autumn (either at the same location or a different location) and maintain it until this action’s end date\n\n## How to do it\n\nIt’s up to you how you do this action, as long as you:\n\n* follow this action’s requirements – these are identified by a ‘must’\n* do the action in a way that could reasonably be expected to achieve this action’s aim\n\nYou may find it helpful to read the ‘advice to help you do this action’, but it’s not part of this action’s requirements.\n\n## Evidence to keep\n\nYou must keep evidence to show what you’ve done to complete this action, such as:\n\n* field operations at a land parcel level and associated invoices, including details of the seed mix used\n* photographs or other documentation\n\nIf it’s not clear that you’ve done this action in a way that could reasonably be expected to achieve its aim, we may ask for this evidence. You must supply the evidence if we ask for it.\n\n## Other actions or options you can do on the same area as this action\n\nYou can do the following actions or options on the same area in a land parcel as this action. Some actions or options can only be done on the same area if they’re done at a different time of year to this action. For example, winter cover followed by a summer companion crop. Read ‘What to do’ and ‘When to do it’ to find out when this action must be done.\n\n| Scheme | Action or option codes |\n| --- | --- |\n| SFI 2024 actions | OFC1, OFC3, OFM1, OFM4, AGF1, AGF2, CIPM1, CNUM1, PRF1, PRF2, PRF3, CSAM1 |\n| SFI 2023 actions | IPM1, NUM1, SAM1 |\n| CS options | OR1, OR3, OT1, OT3 |\n| ES options | No ES revenue options |\n| SFI pilot standards | No area based SFI pilot standards |\n\nIf an action or option cannot be located on the same area, you may be able to do it on a different area in the same land parcel. Read [section 6 ‘Eligible land in other funding schemes’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-scheme-expanded-offer-for-2024/sfi-scheme-information-expanded-offer-for-2024) in the SFI scheme information for more details.\n\nYou can do the following actions or options on the eligible boundaries of a land parcel entered into this action:\n\n* SFI 2024 actions: CHRW1, CHRW2, CHRW3, BND1, BND2 and WBD2\n* SFI 2023 actions: HRW1, HRW2, HRW3\n* CS option BE3 (management of hedgerows)\n* the introductory level of the SFI pilot hedgerows standard\n\n## Advice to help you do this action\n\nThe following advice may help you to do this action, but it’s not part of this action’s requirements.\n\n### Choosing a seed mix\n\nThis action explains the minimum requirement for species in the seed mix (under ‘What to do’).\n\nIf you want to grow a high-quality herbal ley (which goes beyond the basic requirements of this action), the seed mix will usually include at least:\n\n* 5 grass species, such as cocksfoot, festulolium, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, smooth-stalked meadow grass, tall fescue and timothy\n* 4 legume species, such as alsike clover, bird’s-foot-trefoil, lucerne, red clover, sainfoin winter vetch and common vetch, and black medickand white cover\n* 4 herb species, such as burnet, chicory, ribwort plantain, salad burnet, sheep’s parsley and yarrow\n\nTry to avoid a mix of festulolium and perennial ryegrass making up more than 70% by weight of the total seed mix.\n\nYour seed supplier can help you choose a seed mix that is the best match for your land, local conditions and how you’ll manage the ley.\n\n### Where to establish the herbal leys\n\nWhen you establish the herbal leys, by law you cannot cultivate or apply fertilisers or pesticides to land within 2m of the centre of a hedgerow.\nRead the guidance on [Hedgerow management rules: buffer strips](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hedgerow-management-rules-buffer-strips#buffer-strip-rules) to understand how these rules apply to you.\n\n### How to maintain herbal leys\n\nYou can maintain herbal leys by grazing them with livestock or cutting them (or both).\n\nTo help achieve this action’s aim, you can rest the herbal leys from grazing or cutting for around at least 5 consecutive weeks between early May and late July. This will allow flowers to open and provide a source of pollen and nectar for insects.\n\nIt can take up to 4 years for the roots to grow enough to improve soil structure and fertility.\n\nYou may find it helpful to read the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) [guidance on herbal leys](https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/herbal-leys).\n\n## Change History\n*   **2024-05-21T10:29:12.863Z:** First published.\n*   **2024-08-01T15:01:23.372Z:** Action’s aim - ‘minor wording update’.  \r\nWhere you can do this action - an eligible land type is defined in section 5.1 ‘Eligible land types for SFI’ in the SFI scheme information.  \r\nEligibility of protected land - you can apply for this action on the area in a land parcel that does not contain an historic or archaeological feature.  \r\nRotational or static action - this action is rotational or static. Wording on new and existing herbal leys has been removed.  \r\nWhat to do - replaced ‘at least’ with ‘as a minimum’ for the seed mix that you must use.  \r\nWhen to do it - updated wording to reflect that this action is rotational or static for new and existing herbal leys.  \r\nPublished voluntary advice to help you do this action, but it's not part of this action’s requirements.\n*   **2024-08-13T10:18:56.010Z:** OR1 removed from CS options.\n*   **2025-03-20T15:54:52.512Z:** Added detail to explain how Hedgerow Regulations may affect how a farmer does an action, and signpost to detailed guidance on the Management of Hedgerows Regulations.\n",
