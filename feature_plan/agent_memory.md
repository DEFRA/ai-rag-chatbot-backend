# LLM Memory Integration Plan (LangGraph MemorySaver)

This document tracks the steps required to add persistent memory to the LLM agent using LangGraph's `MemorySaver`.

---

## 1. Analysis Phase

- [x] Review current agent state and workflow.
- [x] Identify need for persistent memory to recall user history across sessions.
- [x] Select `langgraph.checkpoint.memory.MemorySaver` as the integration method.

---

## 2. Implementation Phase

- [ ] **Import and Initialize MemorySaver**
  - Import `MemorySaver` from `langgraph.checkpoint.memory`.
  - Decide on a storage backend (default is local file, can be customized).

- [ ] **Integrate MemorySaver with Agentic Graph**
  - Wrap the graph execution so that before each run, the state is loaded from memory (if available).
  - After each run, save the updated state back to memory.
  - Key memory by user/session ID for multi-user support.

- [ ] **Update API/Entry Points**
  - Ensure user/session ID is passed to memory operations.
  - Update endpoints or handlers to use memory-backed state.

- [ ] **(Optional) Memory Management**
  - Implement cleanup, expiration, or reset logic if needed.

---

## 3. Verification Phase

- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Test that state is saved and restored correctly.
  - Simulate multi-turn conversations and verify continuity.

- [ ] **Manual Testing**
  - Run the chatbot, ask multi-turn questions, and verify recall.
  - Restart the backend and confirm memory persists.

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - Test with multiple users/sessions.
  - Test memory reset/expiration.

---

## 4. Documentation

- [ ] Update README and code comments to explain memory integration.
